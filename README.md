# THE UNIVERSE
This is the hub for all details about 3055. 
## 3055 MEANING
The name 3055 derives from the year in time that "The Divided" our characters take place in. 3055 is significant because its a unique and original concept in a space that has many recurring themes. 
### VISION
Our team has been involved in the space as consumers for a very long time. After careful consideration and lots of time spent researching we now have the correct vision to make 3055 a household name. Through our unorthadoxed methods we aim to tackle common usage in our space from new and refreshing angles. 
#### ROADMAP
The 3055 Roadmap serves as a guide for our members to follow, community input is a crutial part to the success for any project. If our community decides that one of our ideas are not worth pursuing than we will scrap it and move on. It may sounds like a clich√© but the ability to take criticism and pivot is essential for running a true community driven project. 
##### Community
History is the perfect marker for what will occur in the future. The history of successful NFT projects is a short one but it is necessary to learn about. Very few projects have been able to consitantly & effectively maintain a healthy community. As we all know twitter presence is a massive part of everyones web3 journey, not only for projects but for individuals aswell. The connections that are made through twitter are life changing and its very important for longevity in the space. In our opinion the most common mistake is that projects tend to focus heavily on the reach of their brand + monetary value instead of extending their growth and reach through community members. One of the ways we will freshen up the space is by steering away from sole personal growth and instead create community who all unite and grow as a unit through our unique engagement tactics.
