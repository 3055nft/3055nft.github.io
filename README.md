3055
# THE UNIVERSE
This is the hub for all details about 3055. 
# MEANING
The name 3055 derives from the year in time that "The Divided" our characters take place in. 3055 is significant because its a unique and original concept in a space that has many recurring themes. 
# VISION
Our team has been involved in the space as consumers for a very long time. After careful consideration and lots of time spent researching we now have the correct vision to make 3055 a household name. Through our unorthadoxed methods we aim to tackle common usage in our space from new and refreshing angles. 
# ROADMAP

The 3055 Roadmap serves as a guide for our members to follow, community input is a crutial part to the success for any project. If our community decides that one of our ideas are not worth pursuing than we will scrap it and move on. It may sounds like a clich√© but the ability to take criticism and pivot is essential for running a true community driven project. 
# COMMUNITY
History is the perfect marker for what will occur in the future. The history of successful NFT projects is a short one but it is necessary to research. Very few projects have been able to consitantly & effectively maintain a healthy community. As we all know twitter presence is a massive part of everyones web3 journey, not only for projects but for individuals aswell. The connections that are made through twitter are life changing and its very important for longevity in the space. In our opinion the most common mistake is that projects tend to focus heavily on the reach of their brand + monetary value instead of extending their growth and reach through community members. One of the ways we will freshen up the space is by steering away from sole personal growth and instead create a community who all unite and grow as a unit through our unique engagement tactics. 
# ART
If done correctly art is a major catalyst to a projects initial movement. Many projects that have superior art can make a solid move forward without the use of instant utility. Art is extremely crutial to short term and long term growth, we can see this from the current meta which has been along the lines of art upgrades. Take Deadgods, BSL, Vandals, and Jikan as examples of how benefitial art upgrades can be. All these factors are apart of the reason why we have taken so much time to perfect our characters art.  We have been through countless revisions to finally be where we are today in terms of our art, after feedback from the team and community it feels like we already have had our art upgrade! 
When we started this project 6 months ago alot of NFT art was animal related, although it worked very well for others we wanted to stand out in a space filled with similar art styles. That's why we went the route of creating a realistic version of a group of human men all surviving in the distant future. It seems that the realistic art style is becoming much more popular possibly because they are easier to relate to. This was our exact thought process when creating our base characters & traits. Through detail, realism, and constant reconstruction our art is primed and ready for the secondary markets!
